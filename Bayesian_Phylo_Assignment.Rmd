**Question 1**

From the trees produced in the R Markdown file propose how many independent CHIKV introductions into Kassala sparked and sustained the 2018 outbreak, and their time of occurrence. How much earlier from the onset of the current outbreak is this estimated to be, and what does this imply? Use tree visualisations and the distribution of relevant parameter estimates to explain your answer.
